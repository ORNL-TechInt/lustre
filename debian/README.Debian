Here is an short explanation what to install on your Servers to set up lustre quickly.
Be aware that this doesn't replace the Documentation and Installation Howtos from Lustre.


#1. Building the kernel and the modules
    You've to download the linux-source-2.6.18|21|22 package and the linux-patch-lustre package.

    Then patch your kernel with the correct patch file. Build and install it. (Use make-kpkg)
    To patch the kernel automatically use --added-patches=lustre as build option.

    Here is the full line how I build my kernel (for those who are not familiar with make-kpkg)
    make-kpkg --added-patches=lustre --initrd --append-to-version "-quota-enabled-lustre-1.6.4.1" --revision credativ.1 kernel_image

    Now reboot into this new kernel and install the lustre modules with:
     - m-a auto-install lustre

    Then the kernel and the modules should be there.

#2. Preparing the system
    In the next step install:
     - lustre-utils

    Then load the kernel modules with:
     - modprobe lnet
     - modprobe lustre
     - modprobe ldiskfs

    This have to be done on every server system.

#3. Creating partitions on the OST/MDT/MGS Servers
    Now you'll have to differentiate between the OST and MDT and MGS Systems
    We'll assume here that MDT and MGS are on the same system:

     - Create partitions:
        - MGS/MDT: mkfs.lustre --fsname spfs --mdt --mgs $device
        - OST: mkfs.lustre --fsname spfs --ost --mgsnode=$mgsnode@tcp0 $device

        Additional options are:
            --reformat                       - this partition was previously formated with lustre, reformat it
            --param="failover.mode=failout"  - don't hang the complete fs if a ost isn't available.

     - Now mount the partitons on the servers:
        - first the MDT/MGS Server:
          - mount -t lustre /dev/sda /srv/mdt
        - now the OST's
          - mount -t lustre /dev/sda /srv/ost


#4. Using the filesystem
    In order to use the FS, you'll have to mount it on a client. Please note that this client also
    needs the lustre-modules to be installed. (You can install lustre-source and build the module
    as described in 1.)
     - mount -t lustre mgsnode@tcp0:/spfs /mnt

#4.1 Using Quota:

    The binaries and drivers for lustre in debian are compiled with enabled-quota.
    So if you like to use quota this is quite simple:
        - lfs quotacheck -ug $path/to/mounted/lustre/fs
        - lfs setquota -u $user 1000 2000 10000 20000 $path/to/mounted/lustre/fs
        - lfs quota -u $user $path/to/mounted/lustre/fs

    If you want to reset this quota informations for a given user, you'll have first to
    set every value to zero, and then give the new informations:
        - lfs setquota -u $user 0 0 0 0  $path/to/mounted/lustre/fs
        - lfs setquota -u $user 2000 3000 3000 4000 $path/to/mounted/lustre/fs

    This behaviour is reported as lustre bug: https://bugzilla.lustre.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14513
