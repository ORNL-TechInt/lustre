FILESYSTEM VERIFICATION TOOL. ( ext3vt )
==========================================

Building tool: 
	To build this tool you just need to invoke make at command prompt.
	e.g.  $ make 
	
	this will compile the sources and build ext3vt in this directory.

Usage: 
Syntax:

./ext3vt [OPTION]... <filesystem path> ... 

[OPTION]
        -t {seconds} for --timestamp,  set test time(default=current time())
        -o {fileOffset}  for --fileOffset, full path of file from which tests should start
        -r run test in read (verify) mode
        -w run test in write (test-pattern) mode (default=r&w)
        -v for verbose
        -p for --partial, for partial check (1MB files)
        -l for --long, full check (4GB file with 4k blocks)
        -c for --chunksize, IO chunk size (default=1048576)
        -h display this help and exit
        --help display this help and exit

Guide lines for using this tool:
	It is expected that ext3vt tool will be run on large size 
filesystem (TB), So it is always better to run ext3vt tool in verbose mode, 
So that one can easily restart device testing from the point at which it 
had stoped. 
for example:
	
	[root@Matrix ext3vt]# ./ext3vtnew -v -f -w --timestamp=1145009417 /mnt/store/
	Timestamp: 1145009417
	write File name: /mnt/store/dir00004/file005
	
If due to some reason sombody breaks execution at this point then one can 
easily restart device from the same point by picking the same file offset 
displayed in by verbose as explained below.

	[root@tucker ext3vt]# ./bdevt -v -f -w --fileOffset=/home/dir00004/file005 
			     --timestamp=1145009417 /mnt/store/
	Timestamp: 1145009417
	write File name: /mnt/store/dir00008/file007
	write complete
	[root@tucker ext3vt]#
One can use similar things for read only and read write modes also.
