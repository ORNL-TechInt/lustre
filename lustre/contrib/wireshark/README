Instructions for Building Lustre/LNet Wireshark Support
-------------------------------------------------------

To compile the RPMs for Wireshark and the Lustre/LNet wireshark
plugins, please follow the instruction in paragraph
'Build with packaging support'.

In case you prefer a lightweight compilation and installation without
any packging 'overhead', please follow the instruction in paragraph 
'Build without packaging support'.


Supported distributions:

    CentOS 6.3   i686, x86_64
    SLES 11 SP1        x86_64
    SLES 11 SP2        x86_64


Software Pre-requisits:
To run and compile wirkshark the following software needs to be installed
    gtk2
    gtk2-devel
    glib2
    libpcap
    libpcap-devel
    perl


Build with packaging support
-------------------------------
Simply type ./wsbuild on a node that match one of the disribution specified
above to create the RPMs for wirkshark and the associated Lustre/LNet plugins.

Upon successs the build results can be found in directory
'wireshark-<version>/packaging/rpm/RPMS/x86_64' relative to this directory.
The RPMs are:

    wireshark-<version>-2.x86_64.rpm
    lustre-wireshark-plugins-<version>-2.x86_64.rpm

If one of the software components that need to be available for
compilation (see 'Software Pre-requisits:' above) is missing the script will
print an appropiate error message. The wireshark 'configure' script might also
detect missing pre-requisite software. In both cases the software needs to be
installed before.

The build can be configured with help of the source file 'wsconfig.sh', but should
out of the box.


Build without packaging support
-------------------------------
Pre-requisits:

- source tree for Wireshark (recommend version 1.6.8)
- build Wireshark according to the instruction in the source tree.
- install Wireshark (usually "make install")

Building Lustre/LNet Dissectors:

- edit the Makefile in the same directory as this README.
- change this line to reflect where your Wireshark source tree is:

INCS = -I$(HOME)/wireshark-1.6.8 `pkg-config --libs --cflags glib-2.0`

- change this line to reflect where the Wireshark plugin directory is:

PLUGIN_DIR  = /usr/local/lib/wireshark/plugins/1.6.8

- save the Makefile after these changes.
- run "make".  (you may need to be "root" for this as it will try to copy the
  dissectors to the Wireshark plugin directory.

As long as the make builds with no errors, you should have the dissectors built
and installed for your version of Wireshark.

To verify that the plugins are installed:
- run wirewhark (typing "wireshark" from the command line is usually good
  enough).
- Select "About Wireshark" from the Help menu.
- Click on the "Plugins" tab of the About window.
- Look in the list for the Lustre and LNet plugins.

If they are there, the plugins are installed.  If not, something went wrong
in the build process.

Note:  You can use tcpdump to capture packets on an Ethernet network, or
ibdump to capture packets on an Infiniband network.  Tcpdump is usually already
installed on most Linux distros.  You can get ibdump from this link:
